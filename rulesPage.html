            <ul>
                <li>The player first chooses the amount they want to bet</li>
                <li>The Dealer deals two cards to the player, and two to themself, leaving one of their own face down</li>
                <li>The player can then choose to hit or stand</li>
                <li>Hitting: The player draws another random card from the deck</li>
                <li>Standing: The player keeps their current cards, ending their turn</li>
                <li>The dealer then reveals their card, and if their total is under 17, draws cards until they reach or exceed 17</li>
                <li>The player wins if the dealer busts, or has a total score closer to 21 than the dealer, without busting</li>
                <li>If the player gets 21 initially, they automatically stand, and the dealer begins their turn</li>
                <li>The player receives their bet back if it is a push</li>
                <li>The player loses their bet if the dealer wins the round, or if the player busts</li>
                <li>The player is awarded the amount of their bet if they win</li>
